# Machine Learning and Data Science Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I created as part of my journey in learning machine learning and data science. Each notebook focuses on different fundamental libraries and concepts, serving as a practical guide to the basics of machine learning and data visualization.

## Notebooks Overview

- **NumPy Basics (`NumPybasics.ipynb`):** An introduction to NumPy, showcasing array operations, indexing, and basic functionalities.
- **OS Module in Python (`OS module python.ipynb`):** Demonstrates the usage of Python's OS module for interacting with the operating system.
- **Big Mart Sales Analysis (`bigmartsales.ipynb`):** A simple machine learning project analyzing Big Mart's sales data.
- **Matplotlib Basics (`matplotlib basics.ipynb`):** Introduction to Matplotlib for data visualization, covering basic plotting techniques.
- **Pandas Basics (`pandas basics.ipynb`):** Exploring Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, covering its core functionalities.
- **Seaborn Basics (`seaborn basics.ipynb`):** Basics of Seaborn, a Python visualization library, for creating informative statistical graphics.
- **Simple ML Project (`simple ml project.ipynb`):** A basic machine learning project, applying fundamental concepts and models.

## Purpose

The purpose of these notebooks is to provide a hands-on approach to learning data science and machine learning concepts. They are intended for beginners who are just starting out in the field and serve as a reference for basic techniques and library usage.

Feel free to explore, use, and adapt these notebooks for your learning journey!
